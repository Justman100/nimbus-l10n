## Branch: treatment-a

# This title is displayed together with the picture of a fox driving a car, therefore a reference to 'test drive'. The goal is to invite users to spend time with Firefox and give it a proper test. If the localization of this message is challenging, consider using a simplified alternative as a reference for translation: 'Get the most out of Firefox'

## Branch: treatment-b

# This title plays on the repetition of open, and that might not work if your locale doesn't translate 'Open source'. You have the option to keep this string in English, if you think it can be easily understood and work well as a slogan, or use an alternative as a reference for translation: 'Support people over profits'.
